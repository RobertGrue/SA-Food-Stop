This family-friendly, non-scary Halloween celebration opens daily from September 21 to October 31, inviting visitors to enjoy a varied lineup of activities and attractions, including daily FREE trick-or-treating. This year, visitors can also look forward to encountering GIANT animatronic bugs, offering an exciting chance to come face to face with larger-than-life moving creatures like bees, butterflies, spiders, dung beetles, praying mantises, and scorpions. These animatronic marvels provide perfect photo opportunities as you trick or treat, adding another layer of fun to the festivities.
